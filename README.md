## Description

Usage of Google Books API engine built with RESTful API with Apollo Server. Back end involved updating middleware function to work with GraphQL API and implementing Apollo server to apply to Express server as middleware. typeDefs and resolvers were used as well. As far as front end use mutations used to execute different functions. 
This allowed to replace existing RESTful API. Which in turn created a search engine for books for the user to search for books and save them.
